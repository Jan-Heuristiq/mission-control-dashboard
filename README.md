# Mission Control Dashboard - Deployment Guide

This is a step-by-step guide to deploy your Mission Control dashboard. This process requires no technical knowledge or coding. It uses three free services and will take about 10-15 minutes.

### The 3-Step Plan
1.  **Supabase:** This will be our simple, powerful database (replaces the Google Sheet).
2.  **GitHub:** This is where we'll store the app's code for free.
3.  **Vercel:** This service will take the code from GitHub, build the app, and host it on the web for us.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Database on Supabase (5 mins)**

1.  **Create an Account:** Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up for a free account.

2.  **Create a New Project:**
    *   On your dashboard, click **"New project"**.
    *   Give it a name, like `mission-control-db`.
    *   Create and save a **Database Password**.
    *   Choose a **Region** that is closest to you.
    *   Click **"Create new project"**. It will take a minute or two to set up.

3.  **Create Your Data Tables (The Easy Way):**
    *   Once your project is ready, look at the menu on the left. Click the icon that looks like a terminal, called **"SQL Editor"**.
    *   Click **"+ New query"**.
    *   Copy the entire block of code below.

    ```sql
    -- Create founders table
    CREATE TABLE founders (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      target INT NOT NULL
    );

    -- Create revenue table
    CREATE TABLE revenue (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      founder_id BIGINT REFERENCES founders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      amount INT NOT NULL,
      date DATE NOT NULL
    );

    -- Create posts table
    CREATE TABLE posts (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      author_id BIGINT REFERENCES founders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      text TEXT NOT NULL,
      type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'win' or 'blocker'
      timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
    );

    -- Create config table (key-value store)
    CREATE TABLE config (
      key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      value TEXT
    );

    -- This part just makes your data accessible to your app securely
    ALTER TABLE founders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE revenue ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE config ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON founders FOR SELECT USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON revenue FOR SELECT USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON posts FOR SELECT USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON config FOR SELECT USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for anyone" ON founders FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for anyone" ON revenue FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for anyone" ON posts FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow update for anyone" ON revenue FOR UPDATE USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow update for anyone" ON posts FOR UPDATE USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow delete for anyone" ON revenue FOR DELETE USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow delete for anyone" ON posts FOR DELETE USING (true);

    -- This part adds your specific data to the new tables
    INSERT INTO config (key, value) VALUES
      ('totalTarget', '200000'),
      ('totalMonths', '6'),
      ('sprintStartMonth', '7'),
      ('sprintStartYear', '2025');

    INSERT INTO founders (id, name, target) VALUES
      (1, 'Tilman', 30000),
      (2, 'Simon', 100000),
      (3, 'Jan', 70000);
    ```
    *   Paste this code into the query editor.
    *   Click the green **"RUN"** button. That's it! Your database is now set up and populated.

4.  **Get Your API Keys:**
    *   In the left menu, click the **gear icon** for "Project Settings".
    *   In the new menu, click **"API"**.
    *   You will see your **Project URL** and a **Project API Key** (use the `anon` `public` one).
    *   **Keep this browser tab open.** You'll need to copy these two values in the final step.

### **Step 2: Store Your Code on GitHub (5 mins)**

1.  **Download Your App Files:** First, download the app from this page. This will give you a folder with all the correct code files.
2.  **Create a GitHub Account:** Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account.
3.  **Create a New Repository:**
    *   On the main page, click the **"Create repository"** or **"New"** button.
    *   Give it a name, like `mission-control-dashboard`.
    *   Make sure it is set to **Public**.
    *   Click the green **"Create repository"** button.
4.  **Upload Your Code:**
    *   On your new repository page, click the **"uploading an existing file"** link.
    *   Drag and drop **all the files and folders** from the app folder you downloaded into the browser window. Wait for them to upload.
    *   Click the green **"Commit changes"** button.

### **Step 3: Deploy Your App with Vercel (3 mins)**

1.  **Create a Vercel Account:** Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up using your **GitHub account**. This links them automatically.
2.  **Import Your Project:**
    *   After signing up, you should see a dashboard. Click **"Add New... -> Project"**.
    *   Find your `mission-control-dashboard` repository in the list and click the **"Import"** button next to it.
3.  **Configure and Deploy:**
    *   Vercel will recognize it's a Vite project. You don't need to change any settings.
    *   Find and expand the **"Environment Variables"** section. This is where you'll paste your keys from Supabase.
    *   You need to add two variables:
        *   **Variable 1:**
            *   **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
            *   **Value:** Go back to your Supabase tab and copy the **Project URL**. Paste it here.
        *   **Variable 2:**
            *   **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
            *   **Value:** Go back to your Supabase tab and copy the **Project API Key** (`anon` `public`). Paste it here.
    *   Click the **"Deploy"** button.

Vercel will now build and deploy your application. After a minute or two, you'll see a big congratulations message with a screenshot of your app. **Click the screenshot or the URL to go to your live dashboard!**
